<h1>What's the Purpose?</h1>
<p>This application if mainly for the use of my SOFT166 Practice assignment.</p>
<p>I ultimately hope to accomplish everything that is requested of me in the assignment guidelines.</p>
<p>While I will be unable to demonstrate my application with everyone else (since I'm in America right now) I hope that everything works as intended.</p>
<p>Right before I left, the hue lights were functioning properly with all my intended features, so hopefully everything works as intended for the due date.</p>
