<h1>Welcome to the Game!!!!</h1>
<p>The game you are about to play is meant to be played in Smeaton 109 with the hue lights.</p>
<p>This is a standard game of Noughts and Crosses (or Tic Tac Toe if you're American... which I, the creator, am).</p>
<p>The game is designed for two people, but can be played single player if you want to play against yourself.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to get your symbol into three boxes in a row. The game will tell you randomly who goes first, and the next player
    shall follow until someone gets three in a row.</p>
<p>Should somebody win or all boxes are filled with no winner, simply click the "Clear" button to clear the game and go again.</p>
<p>When somebody wins, a light corresponding to their symbol will turn on in the room. Once all lights of one symbol are on, the game is over and that symbol wins</p>
<p>If you want to play a new game, simply click the "New Game" button.</p>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<p>1.) This application provides an immersive Noughts and Crosses + Hue Light experience.</p>
<p>2.) For the most competitive of players, as well as continuing the game, there is a "Clear" button to restart the game without losing progress.</p>
<p>3.) In the event you want to play multiple games, there is a sleek, easy to use, "New Game" button in order to begin the experience again.</p>
<p>4.) With the help of The University of Plymouth's Smeaton, room 109, this application now features state of the art hue light interaction which will help our users keep track of the score during the game.</p>
<p>5.) The application also comes with a menu in the top left corner to help navigate the additional information provided.</p>
